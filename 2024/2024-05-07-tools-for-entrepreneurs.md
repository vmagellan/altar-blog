Think about someone you know. A family member, a friend, a colleague.

I'll bet that at some point you've heard that person say something like: " there aren’t enough hours in the day."

For an entrepreneur that's an everyday rule.

Marketing. Product Development. That quick chat but turned into an hour-long meeting. Remembering to eat.  Enhancing your social media presence. Project Management. The list goes on.

Luckily, there are a plethora of tools for entrepreneurs out there to keep you organised and make life easier.

Slack for easy communication, Trello to stay on track of tasks, LinkedIn to build your network, the list goes on.

So I reached out to some entrepreneurs in my network, to find out which tools they can’t live without.

Let's Talk

## Detailed Overview of the Tools for Entrepreneurs

Here’s a detailed rundown of all of the tools for entrepreneurs mentioned above, aside from the obvious ones like coffee and a notebook, as well as a few extras based on our experience.

### 1\. Trello

[Trello](https://trello.com/) is, by far, one of the easiest ways to organise, assign and keep track of tasks as a team. It’s one of the most popular project management tools for entrepreneurs on the market.

![Trello Overview Tools for Entrepreneurs](images/Trello-Overview-1024x538.webp)

It follows the [Kanban structure](https://medium.com/paymo/12-kanban-board-examples-for-beginners-d56cee5df832#:~:text=A%20basic%20Kanban%20board%20structure,as%20your%20chosen%20workflow%20allows.), allowing you to organise projects into topics (or boards as Trello calls them). In each board, you and your team members can create cards for specific tasks and track its progress.

As well as being fantastic for project management, this tool for entrepreneurs can be used for brainstorming, agenda planning, and any other list-based activities.

#### Pricing

Trello operates a “freemium model”. The free tier provides all the functionalities you’ll need as a small startup team.

When it’s time to upgrade they offer a “Business Class” model for $9.99 per user per month, which unlocks additional admin & security features, integrations and automation.

### 2\. Google Workspace – Formerly G Suite

[Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/) is Google’s suite of apps. It’s one of the dream tools for entrepreneurs for its many, unparalleled benefits

![Google Workspace Tools for Entrepreneurs](images/Google-Workspace-1024x456.png)

#### Gmail

It all starts with Gmail, arguably the most popular email client in the world. When you upgrade Gmail through Google Workspace, you get an enhanced version of the client, and the ability to create email addresses with your business domain.

#### Google Calendar

Organisation is key to successful entrepreneurship. And google calendar is one of those tools many of us couldn’t live without.

One of the great things about using Google Calendar with a Google Workspace subscription is the ability to create multiple calendars that are accessible by everyone in your company.

So whether it’s setting deadlines, company-wide reminders or scheduling calls, you can keep your team up to date from one shared source of truth.

#### Drive, Docs, Sheets & Slides

Google’s version of Microsoft Office 365, Drive offers a one-stop-shop to create, save & share documents, spreadsheets & presentations.

With the ability to edit as a team in real-time, it’s a tool we use at Altar.io every day.

Whether you’re writing blog content, crunching the numbers, drafting website copy or creating a presentation for your next investment pitch,  Google Workplace makes it simple and easy to collaborate as a team.

#### Google Meet

In the age of the video call, Google Meet is invaluable. It’s easy to integrate with Google Calendar, it offers screen sharing, video & audio recording (on mid-tier plans and above) and is accessible on iOS and Android devices.

A major benefit of Google Meet is that it’s included in the Google Workspace price, so you don’t have to pay a separate fee just for video conferencing.

#### Pricing

Google Workplace start’s at $6 per user per month on their _Business Starter_ plan. For $6 you get 100 participant video meetings, 30GB cloud storage per user & 24/7 support.

The most popular subscription, however, is _Business Standard._ 

It’s double the price at $12 per user per month. But enables you to record video meetings (with up to 150 participants) and gives you a whopping 2TB of cloud storage per user.

At 18$ per user per month, you can upgrade to _Business Plus_ which unlocks 250 participant video meetings + recording and attendance tracking, as well as 5TB of cloud storage per user.

They also offer an _Enterprise_ plan which adds noise cancellation and in-domain live streaming to Google Meet and as much storage per user as you need per user.

### 3\. MailChimp

[MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/) is one of the markets leading email tools for entrepreneurs.

![MailChimp Tool for Entrepreneurs](images/MailChimp-Tool-for-Entrepreneurs-1024x488.png)

Email marketing is a time-tested strategy for both B2B & B2C companies. And MailChimp makes it easy to create professional, well-designed newsletters. So all you need to focus on is the copy.

#### Pricing
