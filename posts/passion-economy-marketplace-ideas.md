¬†**You are never a commodity when you are being yourself**

A few months ago¬† I wrote about the latest instalment of the web mimicking real-life:¬†¬†[The Passion Economy Marketplace](https://altar.io/the-future-of-marketplaces-the-passion-economy/). Within the article, I discussed how it brings local artisans to a global audience ‚Äì and how that relates to ‚ÄúHomo Deus‚Äù ‚Äì a civilization advancing through a hyper-connected world.

We see broadcasters bring a vast array of individual knowledge and skills to the web.¬† Reaching a potential audience of over four billion people, and growing, with their specialised fields.

Since I last wrote about¬†_The Passion Economy_¬†I've been thinking about new ideas for underserved sectors within passion economy marketplaces that are ripe for disruption. I'll cover them in more detail later in this article.

But first, we‚Äôve already seen makers of different crafts sell and gain a following on a range of passion economy platforms.¬†I‚Äôll start with a few examples.

## Examples of Passion Economy Marketplaces

### Overcast

[Overcast](https://overcast.fm/)¬†is one of the most popular podcasting apps on the market.

Users flock to it for its playback customisation options, ability to organise podcasts & competitive pricing model.

The popularity of the app makes it easy for creators to distribute podcasts. Creators can also monetise their podcasts through a Patreon or other payment link.

### Substack

[Substack](https://substack.com/)¬†offers a free newsletter service that‚Äôs easy to set up and looks professional. Creators use Substack to build newsletters to share their knowledge with their community. It‚Äôs free to use and offers a subscription service so you can monetise your readership.

### Udemy

The Google of online courses,¬†[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)¬†is an online learning platform that allows passion economy creators to share their passions in the form of video lessons.

Creators can earn money from their videos, with Udemy taking a percentage of every sale.¬†\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[nectar\_global\_section id="8975"\]\[vc\_column\_text\]

### Skillshare

[Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/)¬†also allows passion economy creators to upload video lessons to their communities. They focus more on ‚Äúcreative‚Äù lessons. Skillshare teachers can monetise their passion through royalties, referring users to the platform & referring teachers to the platform.

### Etsy

[Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/)¬†is, arguably, the largest online marketplace for handcrafted items in the world.

Here, creators can sell anything from handmade jewellery to clothing and home decor.

Despite these great platforms, I believe there is a blue ocean of new verticals within the passion economy for individuals to bring their skills to the world stage with new, specialized marketplaces in many areas.

## SaaS vs Marketplace vs SaaS Marketplace

There‚Äôs currently a debate between passion economy creators about choosing to be in a marketplace.

In a digital goods marketplace, like Skillshare or Medium, creators earn a percentage based on the time a paying customer is on his/her content.

The formula for creators is, therefore:

**_x users \* monthly fee of the platform \* time spent on own content ‚Äî platform commission._**¬†

This is good in terms of discoverability for new creators. However, big creators with a recognizable name will tend to move to SaaS. This allows them to price their creations themselves and not share their revenue with other creators via time spent.

On a SaaS platform like Substack or Patreon, customers subscribe to a specific creator. This harms discoverability, as they rarely come across other, potentially interesting creators.

The revenue generation formula is easier to understand and more appealing, especially for well-known passion economy creators. It is simply a monthly fee, decided by the creator, minus the commission charged by the platform they‚Äôre using.

**The solution I propose is more of a blend: a SaaS Marketplace model.**¬†

This solution would allow for the discoverability that marketplaces provide plus the individual pricing leveraged by the SaaS model.

A SaaS Marketplace model would provide additional liquidity overall. More customers would try out new creators, on top of subscribing to their own favourites.

The SaaS Marketplace approach also allows creators to recommend other creators to follow. As well as recommendations based on interests that allow users to filter and discover new creators easily.

Nowadays, the world has gotten used to subscriptions, from Spotify to Adobe, and Birchboxes to Netflix. There are, however, some verticals that are ripe for fresh ideas for the marketplace subscription model. We‚Äôll get to them shortly, but first, it‚Äôs important to make sure your project has the potential to become a marketplace.
