Navigating the choppy waters of startup entrepreneurship is no small feat, especially when it comes to product development.

In a landscape that's continuously evolving, staying ahead of the curve is crucial. But how do you maintain that cutting edge?

One proven strategy is to tap into the wisdom of those who've walked the path before you — world-class product leaders.

They can offer invaluable insights into upcoming industry trends, helping you stay one step ahead.

They frequently share best practices, case studies, and lessons learned, essentially serving as your virtual mentors in product management.

Engaging with these experts can also open doors to an extensive professional network and potential partnerships.

Beyond that, their experiences can be a source of inspiration and problem-solving techniques.

Plus, by setting high benchmarks based on their achievements, you inherently elevate your own product's quality.

Lastly, many produce actionable educational content like how-to guides, webinars, and ebooks, acting as a cost-effective resource for you and your team.

In this article, I’ll share the 12 leaders I think you should be following in 2024.

But first, I want to categorise them both in terms of expertise and the company stage they operate in.

## The Different Breeds of Product Leaders

In the intricate landscape of product and software development, the role of a Product Leader is not one-size-fits-all.

Depending on the stage of your company and your unique needs, various types of Product Leaders come into play.

Here’s a breakdown that will help you understand whom you should be looking for at different phases of your business journey.

### Product Leaders by Company Stage

#### Pre-Seed and Seed Stage Product Leaders

At this nascent phase, a Product Leader's focus is predominantly on developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), validating the assumptions, and making the initial foray into the market. They are usually the ones who bring your startup vision to life by aligning it closely with consumer needs and market realities.

#### Series A Product Leaders and Beyond

Once you've secured significant funding and have a product in the market, the role shifts. The Product Leader now specialises in scaling the product, retaining users, and implementing methods to generate revenue. The Series A stage demands a more holistic view of the product that goes beyond the MVP.

### Product Leaders by Specialisation

#### R&D Product Managers

These are the researchers you’ll want to focus on when innovation is at the heart of your product. They drive advancement through cutting-edge research and new product development, ensuring they stay ahead of the curve.

#### AI Product Managers

In our rapidly advancing AI-driven world, being data-driven and applying machine learning models can offer a competitive edge. These specialists are experienced in tailoring them to solve specific business problems or enhance user experience.

#### Technical Product Managers

If you're at a crossroads in terms of product architecture or deciding on the technology stack, a Technical Product Manager’s perspective is invaluable. They delve deep into the technical aspects of the product, making choices that align with long-term vision.

#### Generalist Product Managers

These are the Swiss Army knives of product management. They cover everything from conceptualising the product to devising market entry strategies, often acting as a bridge between various functions within the company.

#### Marketing Product Managers

The magicians in customer acquisition, these managers excel in achieving product-market fit. They are attuned to market dynamics and customer needs, shaping the product in a way that resonates with the target audience.

#### Growth Product Managers

If your primary goal is business expansion, these are your go-to experts. Skilled in identifying and optimising metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), they pave the path for sustainable growth.

Now, let’s move on to the list itself.

This framework ensures that your product and its value proposition are deeply integrated, increasing the likelihood of market success.

**Iterative Evolution**: Through his work on the iPod, iPhone, and Nest, Fadell has showcased the power of iterative design.

#### Why Follow David Cancel?

**Customer Retention:** One of the biggest challenges in SaaS is customer retention. David's strategies for creating customer-centric products can significantly boost customer loyalty, thereby increasing lifetime value and reducing churn.

**Hypergrowth:** In 2011, HubSpot faced rising churn rates and slowing growth. David stepped in and a key turning point was when every employee, including engineers, had to handle customer support due to the company's small size and large customer base. He helped HubSpot cut churn in half and more than doubled its LTV-CAC ratio. Consequently, HubSpot's growth outpaced typical SaaS companies, speeding its path to IPO.

**Conversational Marketing and Sales:** Given his role at Drift, David offers invaluable insights into integrating conversational elements into your product or service, thereby enhancing user experience and increasing conversion rates.

**Data-Driven Decision Making:** During his time as Chief Product Officer at HubSpot and as a serial entrepreneur, David has shown an unwavering commitment to data-driven product management. Learning from him could sharpen your skills in making decisions based on metrics and KPIs, rather than gut feeling.

**Spotlight Framework**: David introduces a framework for categorising customer feedback into three main categories: user experience, product marketing, and positioning. This framework helps you focus on the root cause of the feedback, rather than getting distracted by the subject, thereby enabling more effective product improvements.

**In-Person Customer Engagement**: David earmarks a percentage of his time to talk to customers and prospects in their natural environment. He believes that this approach helps in getting unfiltered feedback and understanding the customer better, which is crucial for any customer-centric business.

In essence, David Cancel's unique perspective stands as a testament to the power of customer obsession. His hands-on approach, from direct engagements with users to developing frameworks that prioritise their feedback, highlights the pivotal role customers play in successful product management.

### 6\. Teresa Torres

**Company Stage**: Pre-Seed, Seed Stage, Series A and Beyond **Speciality**: Generalist, Marketing Product Management

**Value**: For startups seeking a robust, customer-focused approach to product development, Teresa Torres' insights are a treasure trove. Her methodologies don't just rely on raw data; they help you make sense of this data to answer the "why" behind user behaviours, thereby informing more impactful product decisions. For example, she advocates for A/B tests that are meticulously designed to extract maximum learning, not just superficial metrics.

**Previous/Current Companies**: Product Talk, Lean Startup Co., Center Centre

**Follow On**: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/teresatorres/), [Blog](https://www.producttalk.org/blog/), Book: ‘[Continuous Discovery Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58046715-continuous-discovery-habits)’

#### Why Follow Teresa Torres

**Risk Mitigation Through Product Discovery:** Teresa's approach to incorporating experiments in the product development process is practical and risk-averse. For example, if you're considering adding a new feature to your MVP, following her methodology would mean setting up a quick and cost-effective A/B test before fully committing development resources. This significantly reduces the financial and time risks involved.

**Customer-Centricity Over Business-Centricity**: Teresa's framing of opportunities focuses on what a customer might articulate, which ensures you’re solving actual customer pain points. Consider the difference between "We need to increase user engagement" and "Our users need a more straightforward way to navigate the app." The former is a business need; the latter is a customer need. Addressing it would naturally lead to increased user engagement but with the crucial difference of being a solution that starts with the user.

**Community Involvement for Continuous Learning:** Teresa runs Product Talk and is active on LinkedIn, offering not just tips but also providing a platform for shared learning among product managers and startup founders. This is beneficial for founders looking for a diverse set of opinions and experiences that can help them avoid common pitfalls.

**Empowerment of Product Managers**: Norton's philosophy is that PMs should act as "mini-CEOs" for their products. He believes that they should lead cross-functional teams from a position of influence, not authority. This means that a PM doesn't need to be the loudest voice in the room but should be the one who brings together the perspectives of engineering, design, and marketing to build the best possible product.

**Focus on Long-term, Ambitious Goals**: Norton is famous for his “10x not 10%” mantra, which he delves into in “10x Not 10%.” He believes in setting audacious goals that can radically change the trajectory of a product or company.

**Collaboration with Engineering:** Norton’s background and experience give him a deep understanding of how product and engineering teams can best collaborate. He often underscores the importance of mutual respect and clear communication.
