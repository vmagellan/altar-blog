The business landscape is evolving and changing faster than ever. And it’s never been more critical for entrepreneurs to stay at the cutting edge of that evolution. As Wayne Gretsky famously said:

_“Skate to where the puck is going, not where it has been”_

For over a century, business magazines have been helping entrepreneurs stay at the forefront of innovation, through in-depth articles & reports on the current affairs of the business landscape.

And in today’s entrepreneurial landscape, that hasn’t changed.

However, cutting through the noise and finding the magazines that provide true value for entrepreneurs is often easier said than done.

That's why I sat down with our founding team (who have built over 10 startups and helped other entrepreneurs build countless others) as well as some entrepreneurs we work with, to find out which publications help them keep up-to-date with the latest business trends.

I then took their recommendations and built this list: the 10 must-read business magazines for entrepreneurs.

In the interest of full transparency...

Neither myself, Altar.io or the entrepreneurs I spoke to create this list receive any money to recommend the following magazines. They were chosen based on personal experience and the experience of those I spoke to.

## Wrapping Up

Whether it’s from [books](https://altar.io/the-12-best-books-for-entrepreneurs-starting-a-business-in-2021/), [podcasts](https://altar.io/best-business-podcasts-for-entrepreneurs/), or magazines, learning from entrepreneurs who’ve faced the challenges you’re about to face can be invaluable for your startup.

It’s something many successful entrepreneurs do, something our CMO Rui learnt first-hand recently.

Just over a year ago, he set out to interview successful entrepreneurs with the goal of building valuable resources for our community of entrepreneurs.

He realised that many successful entrepreneurs [shared similar lessons](https://altar.io/crucial-lessons-learned-interviewing-successful-entrepreneurs/), one of which was the importance of learning from those around you.
