#### Contents

## 1\. The Tim Ferriss Show

![Business podcasts, the Tim Ferriss Show](images/Screenshot-2020-10-30-at-20.30.38-300x300.png)Tim Ferriss is a successful entrepreneur, probably best known by most for his New York Times #1 bestselling book [_The 4-Hour Workweek_](https://fourhourworkweek.com/)*.* His podcast, [_The Tim Ferriss Show_](https://tim.blog/podcast/), is one of the best business podcasts for entrepreneurs. It is regularly ranked as the number one business podcast on Apple Podcasts. It’s the first podcast to surpass 1M downloads and has now surpassed the 500M download mark.

In each episode, Tim interviews leaders in an eclectic range of industries from business to art, extracting tactics, tools and processes that you can use in your day-to-day. This includes morning routines and exercise habits and more business focussed advice like time-management tips to name but one.

His long-form podcasts are both enjoyable and incredibly informative. He achieves this in the way he deconstructs what his guests share, transforming it into easy-to-digest valuable nuggets of information.

The 400+ list of past guests on the *Tim Ferriss Show* includes Peter Thiel, Jamie Foxx, Seth Godin, Hugh Jackman, Doris Kearns Goodwin and Jon Favreau.

What Entrepreneurs Are Saying:

“Huge variety of world-leading guests from all walks of life. If you’re looking for something to consistently challenge you to open to new ideas, concepts, habits, or strategies— this podcast is unmatched”

“Been listening for a few years now. I’ve also read two of his books. Ferris is able to straddle the line between informative and entertaining. His podcast has helped me evolve. Episode #464 is clearly his swan song that reveals his deeply personal revelations that gives the listener an insight that goes beyond the pale in terms of its healing potential. I don’t see Ferris as a podcaster. He’s one of my teachers on the journey."

## 2\. This Week In Startups

![business podcasts, This Week in Startups](images/Screenshot-2020-10-30-at-20.34.58-150x150.png)

## 3\. Masters of Scale

![business podcasts for entrepreneurs masters of scale](images/Screenshot-2020-10-30-at-20.36.08-1-150x150.png)[_Masters of Scale_](https://mastersofscale.com/) is not only one of the most popular business podcasts for entrepreneurs on the web, it comes personally recommended to me by serial entrepreneur [Yaron Samid](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaronsamid/), who we [recently interviewed](https://altar.io/from-being-fired-to-building-a-multi-million-dollar-fintech-startup/).

In each episode of this podcast host Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn & Investor at Greylock gives us a close look at legendary entrepreneurs and their companies. He deconstructs their stories to show how they have grown from anonymity to global recognition.

Aside from the long-list of legendary guests and valuable insights Hoffman provides, the podcast is brilliantly edited and snappy. The use of sounds brings another level to the storytelling experience, making this podcast as entertaining as it is informative.

What Entrepreneurs Are Saying:

“As an exec in the tech industry, I often find myself looking for inspiration and ideas on how to approach my work. This podcast provides wisdom and insights that help propel me toward sound professional decisions. At times, I am also able to apply lessons learned to my personal life. Double win.” 4/5

## 4\. The School of Greatness with Lewis Howes

*![The school of greatness business podcast](images/Screenshot-2020-10-30-at-20.40.33-150x150.png)[The School of Greatness](https://lewishowes.com/sogpodcast/)* sits high on the list of business podcasts for entrepreneurs on all the popular podcast platforms.

## 5\. The GaryVee Audio Experience

![GaryVee Audio Experience business podcasts](images/Screenshot-2020-10-30-at-20.41.39-150x150.png)[_The GaryVee Audio Experience_](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/podcast/) is one of the most popular business podcasts for entrepreneurs. Why? Because of its host Gary Vaynerchuk.

Vaynerchuk is entirely irreverent, to say he doesn’t give a s\*\*t  is an understatement. Of course, this alone wouldn’t be enough to make this business podcast successful.

However, Vaynerchuk backs up his brutally blunt hosting style with a wealth of business and marketing knowledge that shows why he’s considered one of the leading entrepreneurs of our generation.

This podcast is great for if you want quick, punchy information straight into your eardrums, with episodes as short as 7 minutes. As well as longer-form audio content lasting around an hour.

What Entrepreneurs Are Saying:

“If your first thought is “man this guy interrupts too much he’s so self-centred”, please please please reconsider. Gary’s intent is always to give value to the audience and through that he might interject, pivot and direct the interaction towards whatever he feels might resonate best at that moment, but it’s all for the greater good always. The intent is the game and if it feels like this isn’t the usual back-and-forth casual conversational podcast, it’s cause it’s not. It’s much much better.” 4/5

“It's simple: Listen + Apply = Improved Outcomes. Take even a shred of the content and put it into action. You will see a difference. You may not always like the style, the words, the delivery, etc - but you will gain an advantage by trying what's suggested in this podcast.” 5/5
