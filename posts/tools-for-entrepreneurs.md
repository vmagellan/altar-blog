Think about someone you know. A family member, a friend, a colleague.

I'll bet that at some point you've heard that person say something like: " there aren’t enough hours in the day."

For an entrepreneur that's an everyday rule.

Marketing. Product Development. That quick chat but turned into an hour-long meeting. Remembering to eat.  Enhancing your social media presence. Project Management. The list goes on.

Luckily, there are a plethora of tools for entrepreneurs out there to keep you organised and make life easier.

Slack for easy communication, Trello to stay on track of tasks, LinkedIn to build your network, the list goes on.

So I reached out to some entrepreneurs in my network, to find out which tools they can’t live without.

Let's Talk

## Detailed Overview of the Tools for Entrepreneurs

Here’s a detailed rundown of all of the tools for entrepreneurs mentioned above, aside from the obvious ones like coffee and a notebook, as well as a few extras based on our experience.

### 1\. Trello

[Trello](https://trello.com/) is, by far, one of the easiest ways to organise, assign and keep track of tasks as a team. It’s one of the most popular project management tools for entrepreneurs on the market.

![Trello Overview Tools for Entrepreneurs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmagellan/altar-blog/main/posts/images/Trello-Overview-1024x538.webp)

It follows the [Kanban structure](https://medium.com/paymo/12-kanban-board-examples-for-beginners-d56cee5df832#:~:text=A%20basic%20Kanban%20board%20structure,as%20your%20chosen%20workflow%20allows.), allowing you to organise projects into topics (or boards as Trello calls them). In each board, you and your team members can create cards for specific tasks and track its progress.

As well as being fantastic for project management, this tool for entrepreneurs can be used for brainstorming, agenda planning, and any other list-based activities.

#### Pricing

Trello operates a “freemium model”. The free tier provides all the functionalities you’ll need as a small startup team.

When it’s time to upgrade they offer a “Business Class” model for $9.99 per user per month, which unlocks additional admin & security features, integrations and automation.

### 2\. Google Workspace – Formerly G Suite

[Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/) is Google’s suite of apps. It’s one of the dream tools for entrepreneurs for its many, unparalleled benefits

![Google Workspace Tools for Entrepreneurs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmagellan/altar-blog/main/posts/images/Google-Workspace-1024x456.png)

#### Gmail

It all starts with Gmail, arguably the most popular email client in the world. When you upgrade Gmail through Google Workspace, you get an enhanced version of the client, and the ability to create email addresses with your business domain.

#### Google Calendar

Organisation is key to successful entrepreneurship. And google calendar is one of those tools many of us couldn’t live without.

One of the great things about using Google Calendar with a Google Workspace subscription is the ability to create multiple calendars that are accessible by everyone in your company.

So whether it’s setting deadlines, company-wide reminders or scheduling calls, you can keep your team up to date from one shared source of truth.

#### Drive, Docs, Sheets & Slides

Google’s version of Microsoft Office 365, Drive offers a one-stop-shop to create, save & share documents, spreadsheets & presentations.

With the ability to edit as a team in real-time, it’s a tool we use at Altar.io every day.

Whether you’re writing blog content, crunching the numbers, drafting website copy or creating a presentation for your next investment pitch,  Google Workplace makes it simple and easy to collaborate as a team.

#### Google Meet

In the age of the video call, Google Meet is invaluable. It’s easy to integrate with Google Calendar, it offers screen sharing, video & audio recording (on mid-tier plans and above) and is accessible on iOS and Android devices.

A major benefit of Google Meet is that it’s included in the Google Workspace price, so you don’t have to pay a separate fee just for video conferencing.

#### Pricing

Google Workplace start’s at $6 per user per month on their *Business Starter* plan. For $6 you get 100 participant video meetings, 30GB cloud storage per user & 24/7 support.

The most popular subscription, however, is *Business Standard.*

It’s double the price at $12 per user per month. But enables you to record video meetings (with up to 150 participants) and gives you a whopping 2TB of cloud storage per user.

At 18$ per user per month, you can upgrade to *Business Plus* which unlocks 250 participant video meetings + recording and attendance tracking, as well as 5TB of cloud storage per user.

They also offer an *Enterprise* plan which adds noise cancellation and in-domain live streaming to Google Meet and as much storage per user as you need per user.

### 3\. MailChimp

[MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/) is one of the markets leading email tools for entrepreneurs.

![MailChimp Tool for Entrepreneurs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmagellan/altar-blog/main/posts/images/MailChimp-Tool-for-Entrepreneurs-1024x488.png)

Email marketing is a time-tested strategy for both B2B & B2C companies. And MailChimp makes it easy to create professional, well-designed newsletters. So all you need to focus on is the copy.

The premium versions, starting at $9.99/month open the door to email templates, custom branding, A/B testing and 24/7 support.

### 4\. Google Analytics

[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/provision) helps you track the incoming traffic to your website. It’s by far one of the most useful marketing tools for entrepreneurs.

![Google Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmagellan/altar-blog/main/posts/images/Google-Analytics-1024x574.png)

Essentially, it allows you to see what’s working and what’s not. This crucial information can help you create better marketing campaigns and increase your conversion rate.

#### Pricing

Google Analytics is free as long as one of your website pages doesn’t exceed 5M [impressions](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7042828?hl=en) per month.

### 5\. Hubspot CRM

[Hubspot](https://www.hubspot.com/) is one of the most popular customer relationship management platforms on the market.

![Hubspot from 24 Entrepreneurs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmagellan/altar-blog/main/posts/images/Hubspot-from-24-Entrepreneurs-1024x464.png)

The platform centralises your contacts and offers a range of features that make expediting sales and marketing workflows convenient and easy.

One of the reasons Hubspot is so popular is because of its shallow learning curve. It’s extremely easy to use and isn’t as complex as other CRM alternatives.

#### Pricing

The free version of Hubspot offers a powerful range of tools that will help you build landing pages and manage your contacts & website activity – to name but two.

At $50 per month, you can upgrade to the marketing and sales starter bundle unlocking additional features including ad retargeting, reporting dashboards & automations.

### 6\. Slack

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is one of the go-to tools for entrepreneurs and their teams. The communication tool makes it easy to reach out to your colleagues in both group conversations and direct messages.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmagellan/altar-blog/main/posts/images/Entreprene-1024x420.png)

Features include the ability to create channels, to organise discussion by topic, voice calls and video calls (for premium users). One of the benefits of using Slack is its integration with other tools (such as Trello & Google Workplace).

For example, if a colleague shares a file with you via google drive, Slack will notify you the moment it happens. Or allow you to edit tasks on Trello directly from Slack.

Slack offers apps for iOS, Android, PC & Mac. It can also be used directly from the browser.

#### Pricing

Slack offers a free plan for teams of any size, allowing you an archive of up to 10k recent messages, 10 integrations and 1:1 voice and video calls with teammates.

### 7\. Zoom

[Zoom](https://zoom.us/) has quickly become one of the most used communication tools for entrepreneurs on the planet.

![Entrepreneurs Slack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmagellan/altar-blog/main/posts/images/Entrepreneurs-1024x511.png)

It offers video and web conferencing, cross-platform messaging and file-sharing features. It supports screen sharing, recording and HD audio & visual quality.

Zoom’s *Pro* plan starts at $14.99 per license per month. On this plan, the time cap on group meetings is removed. You also get 1GB of cloud recording per license and the ability to stream in social media.

### 8\. Notion

From note-taking to kanban boards, [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) is one of the best all-in-one tools for entrepreneurs.

![Notion Cover](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmagellan/altar-blog/main/posts/images/Notion-Cover-1024x374.png)

It’s adaptable to any type of team from software development and design to marketing and HR.

The only notable downside to Notion is that it can be tough to get started. It's so customisable that you're greeted with a lot of options. When we first started using it at Altar, there was a definite learning curve. That being said, once you've become accustomed to how the tool works, you won't look back. Also, there’s a huge community of users all with tips and tricks on how to get going.

#### Pricing

Notion provides everything you need to get organised for free, with a *Personal Pro* plan starting at $4 per month.

Their *Team* plan starts at $8 per member per month and includes unlimited team members and a collaborative workspace.

It enables entrepreneurs an unprecedented ability to locate and connect with a variety of stakeholders. Investors, employees, partners, customers are all with reach for practically zero cost.

#### Pricing

LinkedIn is completely free to use but offers several premium plans.
