As you may know, at Altar, we’ve been [operating in the fintech sector](https://altar.io/work/) for the last couple of years. In the early days, we struggled to understand who we should contact at which [funding stage](https://altar.io/startup-series-funding-everything-you-need-to-know/).

That is why I’m glad to share with you our public list of over 150 Fintech investors, we’ve met, with all the information you need to create your wishlist and then go to battle.

But before I get to the list and provide you with some aggregations; I want to first talk about the impact of COVID-19 on the fintech sector and its investors

## The Impact of COVID-19 on Fintech Investments

When the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic hit, investment on a global scale was thrown into disarray.

In Q1’20 there was a noticeable impact on fintech investments, especially at the seed stage, from [Venture Capitalists](https://www.valuer.ai/blog/100-top-venture-capitalists-in-the-usa), Angel Investors and Private Equity.

CBInsights’ Q1 Fintech Report stated that “Q1’20 was one of the worst quarters in 2 years for VC-backed fintech.”

Fast forward a year, to Q1’21, however, and the story couldn’t be more different.

Q1’21 was the largest quarter for fintech funding on record.

[CBInsights observed that in Q1’21](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/fintech-trends-q1-2021/):

“Across 614 deals, VC-backed fintech companies raised $22.8B. This represents 15% and 98% year-over-year (YoY) growth, respectively.”

It's safe to say that fintech investment has rebounded since the outbreak of COVID. Now, let's move on to the list of the most active fintech investors.
