## 8\. Outsite Cowork Café

Located in Cais do Sodré, 3 minutes walk from Time Out Market in the heart of the historic centre, Outsite is a cowork space with a twist. The front of the cafe is open to everyone whilst memberships allow you “behind the bar”. They don’t offer fixed desks but the membership includes locker use, meeting rooms and access to Outsite’s WhatsApp community.

One of the most interesting things about Outsite is, on top of the trendy cafe/coworking spaces combo, they offer coliving just upstairs with a desk in every room. So if you are travelling through or thinking of starting your business in Lisbon, its a perfect way to “test drive” the city.
