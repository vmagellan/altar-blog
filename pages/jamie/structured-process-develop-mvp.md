You're here so that means you're considering a lean approach to develop your MVP. That's a great first step.

But lean product development methodologies alone won't cut it into today's entrepreneurial landscape.

I know this because over the last ten years I've built my own startup (which crashed and burned), worked on dozens of MVPs with [Altar.io](https://altar.io/work), and witnessed hundreds of other founder stories.

The hard truth is, [building a successful MVP](https://altar.io/features-inside-mvp-3-steps-know-answer) is not as simple as coming up with an idea and taking it to a team of developers or a software development company.

Before writing a line of code, you need to make everything you can to [reduce the risk of that product becoming a part of the](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/):

- 42% of startups that fail because of no market need;
- 19% that get outcompeted;
- 17% that fail because they build a user-unfriendly product;
- 13% who mistimed their product;

...you see what I mean.

## A Great Idea Isn’t Enough

A great idea is a good start, but if you want to have any chance of succeeding, it’s vital that you focus on the product from a business standpoint.

That usually starts with thorough research, from numbers on the market to competitor benchmarks or any other information that can help you turn your vision into a rock-solid value proposition.

From there, you set the main assumptions to prove and outline the journey your users will take through your product.

At this point, you’ll have all the information you need to create the ultimate list of User Stories and features necessary to prove the main assumptions in a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) or Proof of Concept (POC).

At Altar.io we call this [The Product Scope](https://altar.io/service-product-scope/).

In this article, I’m going to give you the full process, step-by-step, starting with defining your stakeholders, and finding your value proposition.

## Expert Tip

_“Your MVP won’t work if your customers can’t see any value. Build what customers want and then scale.”_

## Step One: Define Your Stakeholders & Discover Your Value Proposition

Before building your MVP, you need to first do some good, old-fashioned research.

Start by asking yourself:

**“What is the problem/pain we’re trying to solve with our product?”**

The answer to this question should always be at the front of your mind as you move through the process.

Therefore, keeping that in mind, the next question is:

**"Who is your main target? Define all stakeholders involved in your product."**

Get to know them in terms of demographics, psychology, and behavior in the observed context.

With your detailed list of target stakeholders in hand, and knowing exactly what the problem is that affects them, the next question you need to look at is:

**“How do my stakeholders deal with this problem today? Carry out a competitor benchmark.”**

### Example: Spotify's Stakeholders

Let’s take Spotify as an example. Before Spotify existed, their stakeholders had three options when it came to listening to their favorite music. They could:

- Buy it from iTunes
- Buy CDs
- Download it illegally using piracy (At a time when piracy was at its peak)

It’s imperative that before you enter the market, you look at who is already in your space. List your competitors, including their strengths, weaknesses, and positioning.

Then, the final question in step one becomes:

**“Why is our solution 10x better than the current market solutions?”**

This is where you define your **Unique Value Proposition**.

### Elevator Pitch Template

We’ve created **\[name of our Product\]** for **\[our stakeholders\]** who **\[state the problem/pain they’re facing\]**. This product will solve the problem by **\[state your product’s key benefit\]**. Unlike **\[the current market alternatives/competitors\]**, our product will **\[explain how your product differentiates you from your existing competition\]**.

## Step Two: Deconstructing Your Elevator Pitch to Discover the Main Assumptions to Validate

Once you have a rock-solid value proposition and a crystal-clear product elevator pitch, it’s time to set the main assumptions you need to validate.

Looking closely at your elevator pitch, you need to work out:

- Which of your assumptions can be validated with research
- Which features need to be built into your MVP to validate any assumptions that can’t be validated with research

### Example: Spotify's Challenges

Spotify’s founder, Daniel Ek, had to de-risk the opportunity for record labels, by guaranteeing them a year’s worth of revenue. He took a painful short-term loss to earn their trust and set himself up for the long-term win.

## Step Three: User Stories & Feature List

At this stage, you're nearly ready to begin your MVP development process.

There are two critical aspects, however, that are yet to be completed: creating your MVP user stories and building your final list of MVP features.

### How to Write User Stories

A user story is an explanation of the journey through your product from the perspective of your stakeholder. 

Let’s create a few simple user stories based on our previous example, Spotify.

### Playback

As a user, I want to:

- See the title of the track I’m listening to and the artist name
- Have the ability to play and pause the music
- Be able to skip to the previous or next track
- Increase or decrease the volume
- Shuffle or repeat tracks

### MVP Feature List

Using your user stories, create a list of features that you would like to have in your product.

## Wrapping Up

By following this process, you will ensure you’re building an MVP that focuses on solving your stakeholders' problems. Ensure you demonstrate value to your users with your MVP, or they simply won’t adopt it.
