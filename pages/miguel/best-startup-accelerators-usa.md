The due diligence of choosing the right accelerator or incubator for your startup is a process I experienced firsthand when I built my first startup.

As with many other things on that journey, I made mistakes. And I learned the hard way just how important it is to do proper due diligence.

For now, I won’t bother you with the details, if you’re interested in knowing a bit more about that experience [you can find it here](https://altar.io/best-startup-incubators/).

The bottom line is finding a startup incubator or accelerator that’s right for you can be like finding a needle in a haystack. The critical factors to consider to make the right choice can feel endless.

The amount of funding they provide vs. the amount of equity they’ll take.

Profiles of the mentors and the industry they specialise in.

How many startups they’ve funded.

The community around it.

The percentage of startups they accept and the difficulty of the application process itself vs. what they can do for you.

The list goes on.

It’s a time-consuming process that’s all going on while you’re trying to bring your startup vision to life.

So, to make the process a bit quicker for you, I’ve compiled a list of the top 50 startup accelerators and incubators based in the USA.

For the top 10, I’ve added in-depth information that will also help you answer some of the due diligence questions you undoubtedly have.

That way, you can get your applications out of the way and focus on building your startup.

Before that, I wanted to give you a quick overview of the difference between startup incubators and startup accelerators and how they can help you.

If you already have a good idea of that, you can skip straight to the list using the contents section below.

## What Are Startup Incubators & Accelerators

Both startup incubators and startup accelerators offer support to early-stage startups and entrepreneurs. There are however some key differences between them.

In short, incubators focus on startups that are in the product development phase and are yet to have a developed business model.

Conversely, accelerators focus on speeding up the growth of a startup that has already built and launched an MVP. Their product is already in the hands of early adopters and they’ve achieved some sort of traction.

![Startup Incubators vs. Startup Accelerators](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmagellan/altar-blog/main/posts/images/Incubators-vs.-Accelerators.png)

## How Can Startup Incubators & Accelerators Help You

There are several ways both startup incubators and accelerators can help your startup succeed. Here’s a rundown of the top three:

### 1\. Funding Opportunities

Most incubators and accelerators will offer you seed capital to get your startup to its next milestone. More than that, they will normally be able to offer warm introductions to relevant investors for you.

### 2\. A Startup Environment

Many of the startup incubators and accelerators on this list will also offer you a physical space to set up your business.

And you won’t be alone in that space. You’ll be surrounded by other entrepreneurs who’re also working hard to bring their startups to life.

This allows you to quickly extend your network with a group of founders who are at a similar stage to you.

### 3\. Mentorship

The last, and perhaps most important, part of the incubator/accelerator process is mentorship.

Startup accelerators and incubators give you access to successful entrepreneurs who’ve been exactly where you are now.

You can learn from their mistakes and successes to help your startup reach its goals faster.

## The Top 50 Startup Incubators & Accelerators in the USA

As promised, here’s a list of the 50 best startup incubators and accelerators.

They’re ranked based on the support and equity they offer, the number of startups they’ve helped create and the industries they focus on.

The top 10 include in-depth information on both the application process and what you can expect from their programs.

Having applied for several incubators and accelerators in my time, I’ve had a lot of experience with the due diligence process already.

And while some of your questions will be specific to your startup, I wanted to give you the answers to the generic questions in one, easy-to-digest place.

In the interest of full transparency,

Should you choose to work with one of the incubators listed below, neither I nor Altar receives any money from an affiliate link. The startup incubators were chosen based on the experience of myself, my co-founders and our extended network of entrepreneurs.

### 1. [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/)

Probably the most famous startup accelerator on the list, YCombinator has launched over 4000 startups. Portfolio companies include [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/), [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/).

YCombinator will invest $500k when you successfully join their cohort. This payment is made on two separate safes ([Simple Agreement for Future Equity](https://www.finra.org/investors/insights/safe-securities)):

- $125,000 on a post-money safe in return for 7% of your company
- $375,000 on an uncapped safe with a [Most Favored Nation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mostfavorednation.asp) provision.

You can [apply to Y Combinator online](https://www.ycombinator.com/apply/). Your application will only be considered if you, as the founder, have at least 10% equity in your startup.

Once you’ve completed this process, you and your team will be asked to interview.

If successful, you’ll officially join the YC batch. At the time of writing, Y Combinator still operates remotely due to COVID-19.

However, during the 3-month batch, you’ll still have access to all mentorship, guest speakers, group office hours with other companies on your batch and the famous [Demo Day](https://www.ycombinator.com/atyc#demoday).

While the batch lasts for three months, Y Combinator will continue to offer mentorship and warm introductions for as long as your startup needs it. Not to mention continued access to the YC alumni network.

What the Alumni are saying ![Altar - What is Saying](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmagellan/altar-blog/main/posts/images/Patrick-Collinson-acceleratorincubatpor-testimonial.jpeg) “I doubt that Stripe would have worked without the YC accelerator program. It’s that simple. Acquiring early customers, figuring out who to hire, closing deals with banks, raising money – YC’s partners were closely involved and crucially helpful.” Patrick Collison, Founder, [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)

### 2. [TechStars](https://www.techstars.com/)

Second on the list is TechStars, which has funded over 3500 startups to date. They’re the accelerator behind [Uber](https://www.uber.com/), [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) and [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) - to name but three.

Techstars invest up to $120,000 in each startup. They purchase the right to 6% of the company’s Fully Diluted Capital Stock at the Qualified Financing and provide $20,000 upfront. Their 6% common shares will be issued immediately before the Company’s subsequent equity financing of $250,000 or more. You can find [Techstar's full investment terms here](https://www.techstars.com/newsroom/investment-terms).

You can apply to TechStars [using the form on their website](https://www.techstars.com/general-interest). It takes around two to five hours to fill out your first application – you can reach out to their mentors and advisors before submitting for extra help to ensure you’ve portrayed your startup correctly.

If your application passes the screening process, you will receive an invitation to interview with TechStars (this process usually takes around four weeks).

The interview consists of two rounds. Here are some of the questions you can expect during your interview with TechStars:

- If I gave you $200k in cash and said you needed to spend that money on hiring people, who would you hire?
- Who are your (likely) customers?
- What would be your ideal outcome from working with Techstars?
- What are the most important \*leading\* indicators for your business/product? or What’s your most important KPI this week?
- How did you validate this market, and what is the scope of the market?

By the way...

...If you’re looking for the right process to answer the above questions, check out the first step of our [proven framework to bring an MVP to life](https://altar.io/features-inside-mvp-3-steps-know-answer/) – written by my CEO and co-founder, Daniel.

If you successfully complete the interview rounds, you’ll be invited to meet TechStars screening committee.

This committee is comprised of the managing director, program manager and other mentors and corporate partners.

If you pass that, you then join a three-month batch of other startups.

In the first month, you’ll focus on growing your network with 100 mentors from the Techstars network. All of whom are experts in their respective fields and have a host of connections that can help you further.

The goal here is to support you and your startup hone in on your product development, market-fit, marketing, technology, hiring, fundraising, company culture and much much more.

In month two, you’ll take everything you learnt from month one and use it to execute your startup vision. Whether thats building the next phase of your product, identifying and achieving KPIs, onboarding early adopters, etc.

In the final month, you’ll focus on telling your story. This is to set you up for fundraising and Demo Day (which takes place at the end of month three). You’ll develop your pitch deck, prepare your investor collateral and learn how to communicate your vision to future customers, team members and other key stakeholders.

TechStars will then continue to give you support via their alumni network.

“At critical moments throughout our history, somehow someone in the Techstars network pointed us in a direction that led us to where we are today.”

Adam Wilson, Founder, [Sphero](https://sphero.com/)

### 3. [500 Startups](https://500.co/)

With over 2700 startups funded, 500 Startups is another leader in the incubation/acceleration scene.

Their portfolio companies include [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), [Talkdesk](https://www.talkdesk.com/) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).

500 Startups offer every company that joins their ranks $150k investment in return for a 6% stake.

After filling out the application form, you’re in with a chance of being invited to an interview day.

The day consists of three back-to-back interviews with members of their investment team. They suggest allocating around three hours for this process, but it can be shorter.

The general topics they will cover include:

- How does your startup work?
- What proof do you have that it works?
- Why do you and your team want to be part of 500 startups?

If accepted, the fast-paced program lasts for four months, presentially at the location you applied to. Their mentor team consists of experts with operational experience at companies like PayPal, Google, YouTube, Apple, Twitter and more.

On top of the hands-on mentorship, they offer talks and office hours on everything from distribution and customer acquisition to design, UX and fundraising.

Here’s a quick overview of a typical week at 500 Startups:

- Weekly roundup all-hand meeting
- Direct points of contact with mentors and advisors
- Weekly fireside breakouts and brainstorming sessions
- Weekly talks with founders of successful tech startups

At the end of the four-month program, you’ll take part in a Demo Day in front of investors and industry leaders.

“500 Startups does a great job of making sure that we have all of the programming and check-ins we need, without overdoing it. Very few events are required, and the ones that are, like the Investment Lead and EIR meetings, are hyper-personalized to our company, so they are incredibly valuable.”

Bethany Stachenfeld , Co-Founder & CEO, [Sendspark](https://www.sendspark.com/)

The support of the MassChallenge team is unparalleled.  They really care about you and will open so many doors with their sponsors, and network.

The opportunity to present your work in front of 2,500 people is in itself life-changing.

What the Alumni are saying ![Altar - What is Saying](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmagellan/altar-blog/main/posts/images/Gabor-Angeli-Alchemist-accelerator-alumni.jpeg)

“The role that Alchemist played in our particular startup venture was to get us exposed to the business side of things.

We had very little experience about what the components of running the actual sales and marketing and business development side of the company is.

Alchemist actually focuses a fair amount, in both their classes and their mentorship, on precisely this. It was useful to hear a bunch of different perspectives from the meetings and presentations that they gave.

It was especially useful to get one on one mentoring from the various Alchemist mentors that they paired us up with."

Gabor Angeli, Co-Founder & CTO, [Eloquent Labs (Acquired by Square)](https://squareup.com/us/en)

## Wrapping Up

As I mentioned at the start of the article, it’s vital that you perform the right due diligence before signing up to a startup accelerator or incubator.

I hope that the information above has given you the foundations to do that, so you can quickly apply and get your product into the hands of your users.

Just remember it’s vital to weigh the pros and cons of the:

- Funding opportunities vs. equity you give up
- Mentorship they can provide and if it’s related to your vertical
- Network of not just investors and mentors, but also other relevant stakeholders such as potential clients or potential hires.

Good luck and thanks for reading.
